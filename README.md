# 🖥️ Java Interview Preparation for Giridhara Software Services

Welcome to my Java practice repository! This collection of Java programs covers a wide range of essential coding challenges and problem-solving exercises that I have completed in preparation for my interview with **Giridhara Software Services**. Each Java program is designed to strengthen my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and general programming concepts.

## 🌟 About Me

I am **Arun Kumar M**, a passionate software developer with a focus on Java development and problem-solving. With strong foundational knowledge in data structures and algorithms, I have created this repository to showcase my ability to tackle complex coding problems.

- 📍 **Location**: Bangalore, India
- 🎯 **Objective**: To prepare for the technical interview at **Giridhara Software Services** by solving coding problems and refining my Java skills.

## 🔧 Programs Included

Here is a list of the Java programs I've worked on:

1. **ArrayContainingDigitsOfGivenNumber.java**
   - A program that extracts and prints all digits from a given number.

2. **BalanceTheBrackets.java**
   - Checks whether the brackets in a given string are balanced using a stack-based approach.

3. **PrintNumbersInWords.java**
   - A solution to convert numbers into their respective word representations (e.g., "123" becomes "one two three").

4. **PrintOnNums.java**
   - A simple program that prints numbers with some custom logic applied (e.g., print only even numbers or apply a certain transformation).

5. **PrintPrimeNumbersFrom100to1000.java**
   - A program that identifies and prints all prime numbers between 100 and 1000.

6. **RemoveDuplicates.java**
   - Removes duplicate characters from a string or duplicate elements from an array.

7. **ReverseString.java**
   - A string manipulation program that reverses a given string.

8. **ReverseTheNumber.java**
   - Reverses the digits of a given number (e.g., 12345 becomes 54321).

9. **sample.java**
   - A basic sample program demonstrating the fundamentals of Java (e.g., loops, conditionals).

10. **SecondLargestNumber.java**
    - Finds the second largest number in a given array of integers.

## 🚀 Running the Programs

Each of these programs can be run individually. You can use any Java development environment like Eclipse, IntelliJ, or even run them directly from the command line.
